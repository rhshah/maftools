CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
-------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS
    o mafSurvival - Performs survival analysis.
    o tcgaCompare - Compares mutation load from given MAF against all 33 TCGA cohorts.
    o pancanComparision - Perform PacCancer analysis/comparision
    o prepareMutSig - Prepares MAF file for MutSig analysis by fixing descrepencies in gene symbols.

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o plotmafSummary has argument titvRaw. You can set it to FALSE to plot TiTV fraction instead of raw counts.

NON SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
    o Bug fixes and improvements.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.55
-------------------------
    o LollipopPlot axis improvements

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.50
-------------------------
SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o Improvements to lollipop plot. Now domain size remains constant irrespectie of mutation load. Bubble size is defunct, instead everything will be of same size similar to cBioPortals mutationMapper. Added an argument to label domain within the plot, added fn argument to save plot.
    o Default values for removeNonMutated argument in  `coOncoplot`, `oncoplot` and `oncostrip` is now set to TRUE.
    o Added plotType argument to plotTiTv.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.40
-------------------------
SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o Updated validated signatures database. Earlier database contained 21 signatures. Updated table has 30 signatures as on http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures.
    o Updated protein domain database. Now includes ~1000 more protein structures/domains for both HGNC sybols and their synonyms.
    o Added arguments `showMutationRate`, `cBioPortal`, `domainColor` to lollipopPlot. Better handling of labels by collapsing overlapping protein conversions into single string.
    o Added argument `sortByAnnotation` to oncostrip and oncoplot for better sorting options. Thanks to Ryan Morin for sortByAnnotation code.
    o Improvements to plotSignatures function.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.30
-------------------------
Bug Fixes
    o Bug fix in oncodrive while estimating background score for synonymous mutations
    o Bug fix to lollipop plot and added argument legendTxtSize
    o Oncoplot improvment
    o Update oncotate API url
    o Support data.table (v >= 1.10.00)
    o Removed dplyr dependency

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o Functions can be called via namespace w/o loading whole package

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.20
-------------------------
NON SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
    o Major Bug fix in calculating gene summary
    o Bug fix in tumor heterogeneity (character to numric conversion of vaf).

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES
    o Added verbose argument to read.maf
    o Replaced cor-coef with cosine-similarity while comparing signatures against validated-signaturs

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.10
-------------------------
NON SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o Major bug fix to readGistic which earlier caused to drop deep CNVs
    o Replaced for-loop with vectorized code for gistic sample processing
    o bug fix in coOncoplot
    o bug fix in oncostrip which made annotations out of order
    o bug fix in rainfallPlot
    o Added reference build option to plotCBSsegments and rainfallPlot
    o read.maf can accept data-frame as input
    o Minor plot improvements.
